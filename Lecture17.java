    //is an algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array
    //kinda like opening a book in the middle and then going to half with whatever page number you want

    //sorted array
    //value we're looking for
    //i should be 0 and j should be the index of length of array

    //Merge Sort

    //divide the problem into sub problems and then solve recursively
